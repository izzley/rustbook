# Rust book - code and notes

I'm learning rust coz its got a sweet community, runs fast and keeps getting voted as best language by devs.

I'm working through the [rust textbook](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) as well as keeping notes on things I find especially interesting as I go.

If these notes are helpful to you, I'm glad.
